                <h2>Nestinarstvo: Bulgaria's Ritual of Firewalking</h2>
                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
                    The Nestinarstvo fire-dancing rite is the climax of the annual Panagyr ritual on the feast days of Saints
                    Constantine
                    and Helena (3 and 4 June) in the village of Bulgari, in the Mount Strandzha region of south-east Bulgaria.
                    The ritual is
                    held to ensure the well-being and fertility of the village. In the morning, consecrated and ceremonial
                    rituals are
                    solemnized and a procession with the sacred icons representing the two Saints travels outside the village to
                    a spring
                    with holy water, accompanied by drum and bagpipes. At the spring, holy water and candles are handed out to
                    everyone
                    present for good health. The festival culminates in a fire-dance in the evening as the highest form of
                    veneration of the
                    Saints. People silently form a circle around the burning embers led by the sacred drum, and the Nestinari,
                    who are
                    spiritual and physical leaders through whom the saints express their will, begin entering the circle and
                    treading the
                    embers. Formerly celebrated in some thirty nearby Bulgarian and Greek villages, Nestinarstvo remains today
                    in Bulgari, a
                    village of only a hundred persons. During the Panagyr, however, thousands crowd the village, including in
                    recent years
                    many Greeks who join the ritual.

        Lazaruvane is an old Bulgarian custom, which is performed to welcome spring. It is celebrated on the day of St. Lazarus
        – the Saturday eight days before Easter. Lazaruvane symbolizes the growth of the girl – how she gets older and
        transforms from a child into a young woman. It was considered that a girl, who has performed this ritual, is ready for
        marriage. Preparation for the festival begins in the days of Easter Lent when the dancers gather to remember old and
        learn new songs for the celebration. No songs or dances are allowed during Lent, and entertainment for young girls is
        limited, therefore these meetings are greeted with joy and fill the girls with tremulous expectations.

                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
        There are various Mummers in Bulgaria; they even have different names in the different regions – kukeri, survakari,
        pesyatsi, dervishi, startsi, etc.
        Mummery is among the most vivid Bulgarian customs. It is derived from the ancient pagan past of the Bulgarian people and
        is associated with the pursuit of the people to affect nature by means of magic and the supernatural. What unites them
        are their rituals, their large masks, decorated with bells and leather, and the purpose of their rituals – to chase away
        the evil spirits, to purify the society and nature of evil spirits and bring prosperity, good harvest and health. Only
        men can wear mummer costumes. According to the tradition in some parts of the country, there is even a requirement for
        them to be bachelors. The leader of the company, however, must be a married man.

                <div class="content">
        The Bulgarian Orthodox Easter traditions vary from the common Easter traditions: they involve egg colouring, egg
        breaking and Easter bread. Tradition directs that the eggs are coloured on the Holy Thursday before Easter Sunday, and
        the first coloured egg is always red, symbolising Jesus’s rise from the dead. Then the rest of the eggs can be painted
        in all colours and often a wax candle is used to draw on them. The egg breaking custom takes place before the big meal
        and it involves all the family members tapping their eggs against each other after each person has chosen a colourful
        egg. The person with the last unbroken egg is said to have a whole year of luck to look forward to. The typical Easter
        bread in Bulgaria is called kozunak and it is a sweet bread, sometimes with raisins in it.

                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
        After the festive liturgy the priests, accompanied by hundreds of people start a festive procession from all churches.
        They go to the nearest river and the priest throws a cross into the water. It is believed that the one who succeeds to
        take out the cross from the water will be happy and rich all year round. So a lot of enthusiastic men jump into the ice
        cold waters of the river and try to catch the cross. After that people continue celebrating all day long.<br>
        
        Another Jordan’s Day tradition is the icy round dance. Rather than chasing a cross, this involves men dancing in a
        freezing river to traditional Bulgarian tunes. This custom is best associated with the town of Kalofer, though it has
        been practised in other places as well.

                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
        Baba Marta Day is celebrated in Bulgaria every March 1st, coinciding with the transition of winter into spring. Baba is
        Bulgarian for “grandmother” and Marta is “March”, so it is “Grandmother March Day,” or “Granny March Day,” in English.
        The tradition is for people to buy or fashion red- and white-coloured gifts made of string, called martenitsa (plural
        martenitsi). Martenitsi are usually fashioned into a thin bracelet and given to friends as a way to keep away Baba Marta
        (Bulgarian: Баба Марта), who is, according to legend, a very bipolar woman that controls whether or not spring and good
        weather coming soon. Those wearing a martenitsa (Bulgarian: мартеница), which can also resemble a woven ornament of a
        man or woman, called Pizho and Penda (Bulgarian: Пижо и Пенда), are spared the old woman’s wrath of more winter.<br>
        
        The colours of martenitsi are always red and white, and there are varying answers as to why; basically it is a wish for
        good health and prosperity to the recipient for the rest of the year. On the Pizho and Penda, the male doll is usually
        distinguished by its white dominating colour, while Penda, the female doll, is usually mostly red.

        On the 14th of February, Bulgarians celebrate the holiday of vine-growers and wine-makers, known as St. Trifon Zarezan
        (Trifon the Pruner) – the Bulgarian patron saint of vineyards. Trifon Zarezan is the traditional Bulgarian wine
        celebration that marks the time of year when vine-growers trim back their vines. The holiday marks the dividing line
        between the outgoing winter and the onset of spring – the transition between the dead winter season and the invigorating
        powers of the following seasons. There are many rituals performed to ensure vitality and fruitfulness. The first pruning
        of the vines for the season is the main ritual performed on February 14, when people gather in the vineyards outside the
        villages.<br>
        
        Men set out to the vineyards to prune the vines, while women bake festive bread loaves in their houses and prepare roast
        chicken stuffed with rice. They put these and a flask of wine in a woollen bag and see the men to the gate. Women also
        knead special round loaves – a symbol of the fertile field and generously hand them out to neighbours and relatives.

                <div class="content">
        In Bulgaria is celebrated with a meal consisting of an odd number of dishes which follows the forty-day Advent fast.
        This vegetarian meal includes grains, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Walnuts are a necessary component to the Bulgarian
        Christmas meal. Each member of the family cracks one in order to determine their fate for the next year. If the walnut
        is a good one, it is said that the year will be successful. Bad luck is predicted for the person who cracks a bad
        walnut.<br>
        
        Another Bulgarian Christmas Eve dinner tradition involves hiding a coin in the loaf of Christmas bread. The person who
        finds the coin can also expect good luck in the year to follow.
        <br>
        The Christmas Eve dinner table may not be cleared until the next morning to provide sustenance for the ghosts of
        ancestors who may come back to visit before Christmas morning.
